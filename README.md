# A survey of deep learning applications for disease identification and prediction in rice crop

Disease identification and prediction using deep learning (DL) models is increasing in agriculture. This study reviews machine learning and deep learning applications for disease identification and prediction in rice. Its aim is to provide a synthesis of deep learning research in rice with particular emphasis on disease identification and prediction. The synthesis will include results across different model algorithms, frameworks, and uses. Key advancements in image processing technology and insights into why deep learning has been useful in certain application areas will be discussed. New areas of research will be discussed that could benefit from DL models. The survey is expected to provide a valuable reference for beginners with interest in deep learning applications in rice and provide thoughts for further innovation in rice disease identification and prediction using deep learning.
